//! IDE-side implementation of the Claude Code editor integration protocol.
//!
//! This lets the Claude Code CLI connect to Zed the same way it connects to the
//! official VS Code and JetBrains extensions: Zed runs a localhost WebSocket
//! server speaking a WebSocket variant of MCP, advertises it through a lock file
//! under `~/.claude/ide/`, and points the CLI at it via the `CLAUDE_CODE_SSE_PORT`
//! and `ENABLE_IDE_INTEGRATION` environment variables in its integrated terminal.
//!
//! [`init`] wires one [`ClaudeCodeIdeServer`] per local [`Workspace`]: it binds
//! a loopback port, writes the lock file, serves connections until the window
//! closes, and pushes `selection_changed` to every connected CLI as the user
//! moves around, which is the only way the CLI learns what is selected.
